# Amazon Clone (JavaScript Project)

This project is a clone of Amazon built during my **30-Day JavaScript Learning Challenge**.  
It was developed by following [SuperSimpleDevâ€™s JavaScript course](https://www.youtube.com/@SuperSimpleDev), with my own tweaks and improvements along the way.

## What I Learned & Implemented
- Built an **interactive UI** with dynamic rendering using the DOM.  
- Added **event listeners** to handle user actions.  
- **Fetched products and order details** from the backend.  
- Structured and manipulated data efficiently (including recursion and custom workarounds).  
- Used **URL/search parameters** to track orders.  
- Improved cart functionality with an **MVC-inspired approach** instead of direct DOM manipulation.  
- Completed ~250 exercises to reinforce JavaScript concepts.

## About the Journey
This project is the result of my first deep dive into JavaScript.  
I documented the entire **30-day learning journey** on LinkedIn, starting from zero knowledge of JS to building this Amazon clone.

## Next Steps
- Build more projects to sharpen problem-solving and development skills.  
- Explore **Python** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** to strengthen foundations.
